### Sorting Algorithms

- **Bubble Sort:** Simple yet inefficient, it repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.
- **Selection Sort:** Improves on bubble sort slightly by finding the minimum element and swapping it with the first unsorted element.
- **Insertion Sort:** Builds the final sorted array one item at a time, with the advantage of being efficient for (nearly) sorted lists.
- **Merge Sort:** A divide-and-conquer algorithm that divides the list into halves, sorts them, and then merges the sorted halves.
- **QuickSort:** Another divide-and-conquer algorithm that selects a ‘pivot’ and partitions the array around it.
